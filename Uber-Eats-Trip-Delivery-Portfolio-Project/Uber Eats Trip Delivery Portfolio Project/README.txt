<This is it>
This is the complete version of this project. This is ready to run and it works. Nothing else to do. 

One objective:
	- Create a csv file

	- What does this program do?
			- It takes all the pds from a file named "pdf-files" that holds all my pdfs of 224 trips
			- It extracts the data and transfers it into a .txt file into another folder called "trips"
			- from the trips folder where there are 224 text files, it creates one csv file and places it into a folder named "csv"
	
	- One pit fall of this project is that it is dependent on the file structure of my local machine 
		- all the directories passed around in my program are hardcoded strings on files that must exist prior to running this program

	How would I change this program for any given local machine?
		- 2 steps
		- change all the paths throughout this program to be based on the file structure of that local machine 
		- provide or create the necessary files prior to running the program.



---------
One thing I would change is the name of the project to have not spaces, but it is not a big deal.
