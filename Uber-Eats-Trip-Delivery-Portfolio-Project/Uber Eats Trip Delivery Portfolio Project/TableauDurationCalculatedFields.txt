Note: below is the conversion of minutes + hrs and sec into just a grand total of only minutes.
      the second copy-paste is for individual fields of hrs, min, sec as separate columns.
It turns out that date time is the correct type. date is a place holder, and time truly stores the duration
---------------------------------------------------------------
I see, you want to convert the entire duration into minutes for easier comparison. You can achieve this by creating a single calculated field in Tableau that converts the hours and seconds into minutes. Here’s how you can do it:

// Create a calculated field named "TotalDurationMinutes"
DATEPART('hour', [Duration]) * 60 + DATEPART('minute', [Duration]) + DATEPART('second', [Duration]) / 60

In this code, DATEPART('hour', [Duration]) * 60 converts the hours into minutes, DATEPART('minute', [Duration]) is already in minutes, and DATEPART('second', [Duration]) / 60 converts the seconds into minutes. The results are then added together to get the total duration in minutes.

This calculated field will allow you to perform calculations on the total duration in minutes in Tableau. Good luck with your project! 👍



---------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, here's how you can create calculated fields in Tableau to extract the hours, minutes, and seconds from your "Duration" column:

1. Extract the hour component:

```plaintext
// Create a calculated field named "DurationHours"
DATEPART('hour', [Duration])
```

2. Extract the minute component:

```plaintext
// Create a calculated field named "DurationMinutes"
DATEPART('minute', [Duration])
```

3. Extract the second component:

```plaintext
// Create a calculated field named "DurationSeconds"
DATEPART('second', [Duration])
```

In these codes, `DurationHours`, `DurationMinutes`, and `DurationSeconds` are the names of the calculated fields. You can replace these with any names you prefer. Remember to replace `[Duration]` with the actual name of your duration column if it's different.

These calculated fields will allow you to perform calculations on the duration in Tableau. Good luck with your project! 👍
